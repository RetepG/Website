                Teddy in his free time, enjoys being massaged, especially around his belly area.
                Although he loves being lazy he is still a dog that needs to be walked which is great because he loves
                wearing his tiny shoes on adventures.

                Teddy was simply mesmerized by the penguin stuffed animal.
                Resulting in a funny face that looks like he is praising the almighty penguin.
